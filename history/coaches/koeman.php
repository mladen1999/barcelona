                <p class="font-weight-bold">The Dutchman joined Barça as first-team coach in the summer of 2020, after having played for the club for six seasons (1989-1995)</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Born in Zaandam (Holland) on March 21, 1963, Ronald Koeman became the coach of the FC Barcelona first-team in the summer of 2020. After a great career as a coach with more than 20 years of experience, the Dutchman arrived at Barça to begin his tenure at the start of the 2020/21 season.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Previously, Koeman had managed Vitesse, Ajax, Benfica, PSV, Valencia, AZ Alkmaar, Feyenoord, Southampton, Everton and the Dutch national team. During those years, the Dutchman won a total of eight titles: two Eredivisie, a Dutch Cup and a Dutch Super Cup with Ajax, a Portuguese Super Cup with Benfica, an Eredivisie with PSV, a Copa del Rey with Valencia and a Dutch Super Cup with AZ Alkmaar.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Ronald Koeman’s era as Barça coach was a difficult one, in times of crisis and at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the club suffering from financial problems, and with the loss of its biggest star, Leo Messi, at the start of the 2021/22 season. However, Koeman did lead the club to the Copa del Rey title in 2021, with three epic comebacks against Rayo, Granada and Sevilla along the way and an extraordinary performance in the final to beat Athletic Club 4-0.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Koeman was relieved of his duties on 27 October 2021, after 67 games in charge: 48 in La Liga, eleven in the Champions League, six in the Copa del Rey and two in the Spanish Super Cup. His record was 39 wins, 12 draws and 16 defeats, with 138 goals for and 75 against.</p>
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold">As a player...</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Koeman was a true legend as a player at Barça, where he played for six seasons (from 1989 to 1995). During his 264 official matches for the club, and despite being a defender, he scored 88 goals, mainly thanks to his wonderful ability from set pieces. As a Barça player, Koeman won a total of 10 titles: four leagues, a European Cup, a Copa del Rey, a European Super Cup and three Spanish Super Cups.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Apart from the goals, the games and the titles, Koeman is especially remembered by Barça fans for the final at Wembley in 1992. The Dutchman was the scorer of the only goal against Sampdoria in extra time that allowed the Catalans to proclaim themselves European Cup winners for the first time in club history. </p>
