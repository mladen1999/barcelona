                <div class="container">
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Quique Setién (September 27, 1958, Santander) was presented as FC Barcelona's new coach on January 14, 2020, taking over from Ernesto Valverde, who had occupied the position for the past two and a half seasons.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">The third Cantabrian coach in the history of the club – following on from Enrique Orizaola and Laureano Ruiz - came to Barça after spells coaching Racing Santander, Poli Ejido, Logroñes, Lugo, Las Palmas and Betis, his last team before taking the FC Barcelona and who he led to a place in the Europa League in the 2017/18 season.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Despite not having claimed any silverware, Quique Setién has made a name for himself thanks to the style of play utilized at all his previous clubs. In all of them, the coach promoted a markedly offensive possession based style of football, one almost identical to Barça’s DNA. In fact, Quique Setién had often admitted - before signing for the blaugranes - that he admired Johan Cruyff and Barça’s philosophy.</p>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Quique Setién came to Barça as coach on 13 January 2020. During his seven months in charge the Cantabiran coached the first team in 25 matches: 19 in the league, three in the Champions League and three in the Copa del Rey.</p>
                <h4 class="font-weight-bold">As a player...</h4>
                <p class="font-weight-bold">Quique Setién is remembered as a capable midfielder, who completed much of his career at Racing Santander (1977-85 and 1992-96), the team where he began and developed during his early years in football. He also played for Atlético Madrid under Luis Aragonés (1985-88) and Logroñes (1988-92), before returning to Racing Santander, prior to signing for Levante, his last team.</p>
